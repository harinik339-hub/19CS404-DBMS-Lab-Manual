### Entities and Attributes


| Entity |           Attributes (PK, FK)     |         Notes                |

|Payment | PaymentID,Amount                  | Tracks payments by members   |


### Relationships and Constraints

|    Relationship    | Cardinality   |                 Participation                  |                Notes                  |
